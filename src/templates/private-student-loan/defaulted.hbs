    <p>Dear {{agency.name}},</p>
    <p>I am writing with regard to account number {{user.account}}. You most recently contacted me about this account on
      {{lastCorrespondence}} (copy enclosed). I am disputing the alleged debt.</p>
    <p>Please provide me with the following documentation, to which I am legally entitled under the Fair Debt Collection
      Practices Act and similar state law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Proof that I signed the promissory note and/or contact associated with this debt;</li>
      <li>Proof that you are the present owner or holder of the note, including the entire chain of title tracing your
        possession to the original issuance;</li>
      <li>Proof that the note is in default.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because I am disputing this debt, you should not report it to any credit reporting agency. If you have already
      reported it, please notify any credit reporting agencies to which you or any of the previous holders of this debt
      have furnished information
      concerning it that the debt is disputed and/or delete the trade-line from my credit report. As you know, reporting
      information that you know to be inaccurate, or failing to report information correctly, violates the Fair Debt
      Collection Practices
      Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and other pertinent state and federal laws.</p>
    <p>Aside from verifying the debt, <u>do not contact me about this debt</u>. As you know, the Fair Debt Collection
      Practices Act and applicable state law requires that you honor this request.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this letter should be read as a waiver of any of my rights under state or federal law.</p>
    <p>Be advised that I have documented all correspondence with respect to this debt and will not hesitate to report
      any violates of the law to my State Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Better Business
      Bureau. Nor will I hesitate
      to contact my attorney if necessary. I am a member of the Debt Collective.</p><br />
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>{{user.name}}</p>
